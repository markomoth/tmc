		<strong>30th March 2025</strong> - First I was at some donation event when I was taken by a bus with a bunch of people in a large garden or park all walking around in a circle and were gathering money for someone or something. It was a beautiful park with animals and my friend was there so we went around for a walk. We tried taking pictures of some animals. There was this beautiful wild cat, a small deer, some birds, and then I found an owl which was in some tree house, and there was a ladder next to a tree. I tried to climb the ladder to take a picture of the owl but some guy came out and said "no you can't get that close to the owl itâ€™s gonna fly away, you need to take a picture from the distance" or something. But I still managed to take beautiful photos.
