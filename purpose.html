		<p>I have originally written my first post on the blog in a day, which was also the same day I wrote the website it is on. And now that two months have passed, I am realising how difficult it is to write a follow up. But maybe I am simply lacking a (trajectory of the blog). So what do I want to write about?</p> 		<p>Well, the whole idea of The Moth Chronicle and having a custom website is to have a space that is unapologetically authentic. No social media links, no ads, and no likes or upvotes or algorithms of any kind. Just a place to post direct thoughts and musings. And I think the answer should be very simple, in that the postst should just be very unfiltered thoughts and feelings I get throughout the days/weeks before writing the post. But for some reason that approach doesn’t work. I keep getting caught thinking about what it would look like for someone to read this, and trying hard to make the posts be worthwhile for someone who may happen to stumble upon the website, and not be just relevant to me. This has been going on for weeks and has been looping back to the concept of intent, and purpose.</p> 		<p>I personally put a lot of weight on intent. And I think this is also a very universal thing - people simply care about what the intention behind something is. It is what separates human work from something random, or AI generated, or systematic, routine stuff. When we do something we usually do it with the intent of it serving as a conduit to something deeper; we do things according to what our values are and what we want to share. There is a reason why a poet would write a poem, besides it just being a form of art that exists on its own. The intent is to say something, and share something others can absorb.</p> 		<p>And what am I sharing? A simple life. A window into someone who is getting through the days. I do not consider myself an artist, or a poet, or anything spectacular other than a person with feelings, values, hopes, and dreams. Not too different from anyone reading these posts. And the intention behind sharing anything here is simply saying that I am here, and that my thoughts have value. A value that doesn’t need to be high, or important, but valuable nonetheless.  If I get the chance to share something new or informative, that is great, but mostly I hope to just continue to be relevant to the human experience. And in the age of algorithms and ads and AI generated content, maybe this is just my way of contributing to what I believe is the core of the internet - people sharing their life online, and being unapologetically human in the process.</p>
